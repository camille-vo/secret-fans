## About
I got this template from https://github.com/minimal-ui-kit/material-kit-react. 

## Setup
### Prerequisites
Download node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/?msclkid=11312300b56d11ec868695d535388e34

### Clone repository to run locally
1. Click on the green "Code" button in the top right corner and copy the https link
2. In a teminal (like Powershell), go to the directory where you'd like your local code to be stored
3. Type "**git clone**" and the link you copied
4. Type "**git checkout**" and your name to switch to your personal branch (I made a branch for everyone so each person can have a place to mess around without worrying about messing anything up)
5. For more details see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?msclkid=601f1520b56d11ecbda4deb076b23123

### Run the project
1. Run "**npm install** to install all the dependencies
2. Run "**npm start**" to run the project. A new browser tab should open with the template. You did it!
3. If a new tab doesn't open, go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/app
