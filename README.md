## About
I got this template from https://github.com/minimal-ui-kit/material-kit-react. 

## Setup
### Prerequisites
Download **node.js** from https://nodejs.org/en/download/?msclkid=11312300b56d11ec868695d535388e34

Optional: **VS Code** https://code.visualstudio.com/Download?msclkid=b9d0224cb57111ec955ab846f5db5430. I'd recommend using VS Code because it makes all the git stuff easy to see and visualize.

### Clone repository to run locally
1. Click on the green "Code" button in the top right corner and copy the https link
2. In a teminal (like Powershell), go to the directory where you'd like your local code to be stored
3. Type "**git clone**" and the link you copied
4. Type "**git checkout**" and your name to switch to your personal branch (I made a branch for everyone so each person can have a place to mess around without worrying about messing anything up)
5. For more details see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?msclkid=601f1520b56d11ecbda4deb076b23123

### Run the project
1. Run "**npm install**" to install all the dependencies
2. Run "**npm start**" to run the project. A new browser tab should open with the template. You did it!
3. If a new tab doesn't open, go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/app

### When you like your changes
You can make any changes you want without worrying about messying anything up. In the worst case scenario, you can always delete you branch and create a new one
When you've made cool changes that you want everyone to see, type "**git commit -m**" and a short message about what changes you made.
Then type "**git push**" to send the last commit to Github. Everyone else will be able to see the changes you made on your branch now

Once the project progesses, everyone else will probably want to put your changes on their own branches. For this, you'll need to make a pull request. We'll worry about that later
